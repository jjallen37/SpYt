A chrome extension that provides additional touch support for YouTube.

I enjoy using my Surface Pro 4 to watch videos on YouTube, but the touch controls for the default YouTube player do not support commands outside of Pause (Single Tap) and Full Screen (Double Tap). I wanted to be able to do the equivalent of pressing Left/Right Arrow keys on the keyboard, to shortly rewind or fastforward. As a solution to this problem, this chrome extension will add menus to any YouTube viewing page that are positioned for a user holding a tablet.
